FiveM script for revive and heal, works with ND_Core for department specific commands and fax-revive for proper revive.  

/revive - Revive a player.  
/heal - Heal a player.  

To change a fire and rescue department name in the script, open client.lua file and change the value of "department" variable. (first line of client.lua).  
To enable/disable fax-revive integration, change variable value in client.lua file to true/false. (second line of client.lua).
